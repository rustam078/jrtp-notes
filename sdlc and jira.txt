=====================================
What is Software Development Life Cycle ?
====================================

-> The SDLC refers to a methodology

-> SDLC clearly defines the process of creating high-quality software project

-> SDLC methodology focuses on below phases of software development


1) Requirements Analysis

2) Planning

3) Software Design or Architectural Design

4) Development

5) Testing

6) Deployment

7) Support


-> We have several methodologies in SDLC

1) Waterfall Model

2) V-Model

3) Spiral Model

4) Agile Model


==============
Waterfall Model
==============

-> Waterfall Model introduced in 1970

-> The waterfall Model was the first model that introduced as Process Model.

-> It is a linear or sequential approach to develop software projects

-> It is also called as step By step approach to develop the projects

-> In this model we will complete one phase then we will move on to next phase

Note: Going back to previous phase is not allowed in waterfall model.

==================
When to use Waterfall
==================

-> When requirements are fixed

-> When Project is small

-> When Project budget is fixed


=======================
Dis-Advantages of Waterfall
=======================

-> Risk is high

-> Requirements can't be changed in middle

-> We can't go to previous phase

-> Testing will happen at the end

-> Client involvement is very very less


#################
Agile Methodology
################

-> Agile is one of the SDLC methodology

-> It is a way to manage the project by breaking into several phases

-> Agile is also called as an iterative approach to develop and deliver the project

-> We can achieve continuous development and continuous delivery using Agile Model

-> It involves constant colloboration with stake holders (clients)

-> Continuous improvement at every stage

-> Client Feedback is most critical part in Agile Methodology

-> In Agile, Planning, Implementing, Testing and Delivering is a cyclic process


================
Agile Terminology
================

Backlog Grooming  : A Team meeting to identify pending works in the project.

Stories  : Tasks (work)

Backlog Stories: Pending Stories in the project.

Note: In backlog grooming meeting, team members will create backlog stories

Story Points : Duration to complete the story (3 points - 1 day, 5 points - 2 days, 8 Points - 3 days)

Sprint Planning : A Team meeting to identify priority stories to work in the Sprint.

Sprint  : Set of stories to complete (Sprint Goal) & Sprint Duration - 2 weeks (10 working days)

Scrum : It is a process   (Daily team meeting to discuss work status for 15 - 20 minutes) 

Retrospective : Review meeting after few sprint(s) completed 

				(What went well, What went wrong, achievements, improvements, lessons learnt, new ideas)

Note: We have monthly one retrospective meeting.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Owner : Responsible for Deliverables

Scrum Master  : Who will manage Agile teams

Tech Lead  : Seniour Team Members (Who will help team members technically)

Team Members : Developers & Testers


Agile Team Size : 7 - 10 members (Industry Standards)


=======
JIRA
=======

-> Jira is called as project management software

-> In companies, project work will be managed by using JIRA s/w

-> JIRA software is also used for Bug Reporting

-> JIRA software developed by Atlasian company (BitBucket also from same company)

-> JIRA is a commercial software (we need to purchase license to use for commerical purpose)

Note: We can use JIRA trail version for practise. In IT companies we will use paid version of JIRA.


==============
JIRA Assignment
===============

1) Login into JIRA
2) Create Project in JIRA
3) Create Backlog Stories in JIRA
4) Drag the backlog stories to Sprint
5) Start the Sprint
6) Assign the story to your name and change story status to In-Progress
7) Add story comments and change status to Done



Note: In few projects, scrum master will assign stories to team members to work. 

-> In few projects no body will assign the story to us, we have to assign story to ourself and we have complete it.

-> After story is completed we have to change story status to DONE.

Note: Every day we have to give our story status to scrum master in scrum call.

-> If we are not able to complete any story with in given time then we need to explain the reason in the scrum call.

Note: If we don't have any stories to work then we need to discuss with Scrum Master regarding work.
