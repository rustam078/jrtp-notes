Today's session : Project Lombok 


Note: Today' evening 8:45 PM (IST) Angular sessions will start (portal access will be provided for zoom link)

From Wednesday @7:00 AM Docker & Kubernetes will start (we will provide portal access for zoom link)
============================================================================================




--> Every Project will be developed using layer architecture

1) User interface ( front end) layer
2) Web layer (controllers ---> responsible for handling user request & response)
3) Service layer ( business logic)
4) DAO layer ( data access layer --> responsible to communicate with database)

-> When we have this layered architecture we need to transfer the data from one layer to another layer 

			
						     data
			 frontend <-----------------------> backend
						     data
			

-> To represent data we will use classes & objects in the project

Note: Java is object oriented programming language, everything will be represented in the form of objects.

-> The java classes which are used to represent the data they are called as binding classes.

-> In one project we will use several binding classes.

-> In all binding classes, same kind of code will be available. This is called boiler plate code.


EX:

setter methods
getter methods
0-param constructor
parameterized constructor
hashCode ( ) method
equals ( ) method
toString ( ) method etc......


==============
Project Lombok
==============

-> Project Lombok is a third party library which is used to avoid boiler plate code in java classes

Note: The code which is repeated in multiple classes is called as Boiler Plate Code.

-> Instead of we are writing boiler plate code we can use Lombok to generate that code.

===================================
How to use Project Lombok in our Project
===================================

Step-1 : Download Project Lombok Jar file from internet

			URL : https://projectlombok.org/download

Step-2 : Run Project Lombok jar file using below command

		/>  java -jar  <lombok-jar-file>

Step-3 : When we execute above command, it will open a window then select the location of your IDE till STS.exe / Eclipse.exe file then click on 'Install'

Step-4 : Add Project Lombok dependency in Maven Project pom.xml file
			
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.24</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

Step-5 : Re-Start your IDE


Step-6 : Use Project Lombok provided Annotations in java class to avoid boiler plate code

@Setters   : To generate setter methods for the variables in the class 

@Getters  : To generate getter methods for the variables in the class

@SettersAndGetters : It is the combination of @Setters + @Getters

@NoArgsConstructor : It is used to generate 0-param constructor

@ToString : It is used to generate toString ( ) method

@EqualsAndHashCode: It is used to generate equals ( ) method and hashCode ( ) method


Note: Instead of writing all the above annotations we can use @Data

@Data   = @Setters + @Getters + @NoArgsConstructor + @ToString + @EqualsAndHashCode

@AllArgsConstructor : It is used to generate constructor with all variables as constructor arguments.
