Debugging
==========

-> Debugging is the proecss of executing the code line by line

-> Using Debugging we can understand program execution flow in our system

-> Using Debugging we can identify exceptions occuring in the program

-> Debugging will help us in understanding root cause of the problem

-> Debugging is a mandatory skill for every developer.

-> Without having debugging knowledge we can't work in realtime project

-> We can perform code debugging using IDEs ( Eclipse / STS / Intelli J )

Note: If you write the program in text editors (notepad, notepad++) we can't do debugging.

===========================
How to perform Debugging
==========================

Step-1 : Keep Breakpoints in the code ( The place from where we need to start debugging )

Note: Just right click on line number to keep or remove breakpoint.

Step-2 : Run the project in Debug Mode (Right Click on Project / Program, Choose Debug Option to Run)

Step-3 : Use debug shortcuts to debug the program / project

			F5  --> Go inside calling method

			F6  --> Go to next line

			F7  --> Come back to caller method

			F8  --> Go to next break point


Note: In few keyboards, Fn key press is required to use F5, F6, F7 and F8 keys

=================================
What is Drop To Frame in Debugging ?
==================================

-> It is used to re-start method execution in debug mode.



-> When we are in debug mode we can change values of the variables for testing purpose
