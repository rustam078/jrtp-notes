==========================
What is Unit Testing ?
==========================

=> The process of testing individual units of software is called as Unit testing

=> Unit means piece of code ( we can consider one method as one unit )

=> The purpose of Unit Testing is to verify the behaviour of our code and fix if there are any bugs

=> The main aim of unit testing is to provide high quality code (bug free code)

=> Developers are responsible to perform Unit Testing

=> Unit Testing will happen in development phase only

=================
What is Junit ?
=================

-> Free & Open source software

-> Used for java projects unit testing

-> Releasedi in 1997

-> Latest Version of Junit is 5.x

Note: It is used for only Java projects and it is developed using Java.


1) Junit Jupiter : Programming Support + New Annotations

2) JUnit Vintage : Backward compatability (Junit 3 and Junit 4 )

3) Junit Platform  : Environment to run our Junit test cases

==================
Junit Annotations
==================

@Test
@BeforeEach
@AfterEach
@BeforeAll
@AfterAll
@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource

==================
Junit Assertions
=================

-> Assertions are used to compare expected results with actual results

-> Assertions class provided several static methods

assertEquals( ) 
assertNotEquals ( )
assertNull ( )
assertNotNull ( )
assertThrows ( )
















==========
Mocking
==========

=> The process of creating substitute object for real object is called as Mocking

		Ex:  Service layer methods is calling DAO layer method

=> When we are performing Unit testing for service then only service method code we should test (DAO code shouldn't execute).

Note: Here we will create Mock object for DAO and inject into service.

=> We have several Mock frameworks to implement Mocking.

1) EasyMock
2) PowerMock
3) Wiremock
4) Mockito

How to perform Unit Testing For REST API
=========================================


@WebMvcTest : It is represent which class we are testing and it provides required environment for that


@MockBean : It is used to create Mock object for class / interface


MockMvc : This class provides methods to make HTTP Request




@WebMvcTest(value = WelcomeRestController.class)
public class WelcomeRestControllerTest {

	@MockBean
	private WelcomeService service;

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mvc;

	@Test
	public void welcomeMsgTest() throws Exception {

		when(service.getWelcomeMsg()).thenReturn("Welcome to Ashok IT...");

		MockHttpServletRequestBuilder reqBuilder = MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/welcome");

		MvcResult mvcResult = mvc.perform(reqBuilder).andReturn();

		MockHttpServletResponse response = mvcResult.getResponse();

		int statusCode = response.getStatus();

		assertEquals(200, statusCode);
	}
}

========================
What is Code Coverage ?
========================

=> It is the process of identifying how many lines of code is tested as part of Unit Testing in our project.

Note: Industry Standard is 80% of coverage.

=> We can use Jacocco plugin to see code coverage Report.

========================Jacocco Plugin =============
<plugin>
				<groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
				<artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>0.8.2</version>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<goals>
							<goal>prepare-agent</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
					<execution>
						<id>report</id>
						<phase>test</phase>
						<goals>
							<goal>report</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
</plugin>


=========================================================


=> When we join in a project, first 3 Months they will assign below tasks for you

1) Sonar Issues Fixing

2) JUnits Implementation

3) Code Coverage Improvement
