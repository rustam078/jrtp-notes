========
CO API
=======

=> CO API is responsible to generate and send notices to citizens based on their eligibility data

=> CO api will read pending triggers from CO_TRIGGERS table and then it will generate notice with citizen eligiblity data
     and it will send notice to citizen email.

=> After sending notice to citizen  CO api will update trigger as completed.

================
CO Business Logic
================

1) Read all pending triggers from CO_TRIGGERS table

2) Process Each Pending Trigger

			2.1 ) Get Eligibility data based on caseNum
			2.1 ) Get Citizen data based on AppId
			2.3 ) Prepare PDF with Citizen Data + Eligibility data
			2.4 ) Store PDF into DB Table  (later we will discuss how to store into AWS S3 bucket)
			2.5 ) Send PDF to citizen email
			2.6 ) Update the trigger as completed.

3)  Send the final response ( Total Records Processed, Success Count, Failure Count ) from API





========================= Skelton ==============

public CoResponse generateNotices ( ) {

	CoResponse response = new CoResponse( ) ;

	long successCnt = 0;
	long failureCnt = 0;

	List<CoTrigger> list = coTrgRepo.findByTrgStatus("Pending");

	for(CoTrigger trg : list){
		try {
			processTrigger(trg);
			successCnt ++ ;
		}catch(Exception e){
			failureCnt ++ ;
		}		
	}

	response.setTotalTriggers(Long.valueOf(pendingTrgs.size()));
	response.setSuccTriggers(successCnt);
	response.setFailedTrigger(failureCnt);

	return response;
}

public void processTrigger(CoTrigger trg){

		Long caseNum = trg.getCaseNum ( ) ;

		// get eligiblity data based on casenum (ed_elig_dtls)

		// get citizen applied plan info using casenum (dc_cases)

		// get plan name based on plan_id (plan_master)

		// get citizen data based on app_id  (citzen_apps)

		byte[ ]  file = null;

		if(status.equals("Approved"){
			file = buildApPdf();
		}else{
			file = buildDnPdf ( );
		}

		// send pdf in email as attachment.
		// store pdf into s3 bucket
		// update trigger info in co_triggers table (pdf + status as 'Completed')
		
}
